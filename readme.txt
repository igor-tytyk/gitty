Grammarly-Computational Linguist-Task2


1) English Wiktionary dump 'enwiktionary-20121116-pages-articles.xml' from
http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/ was downloaded to the local
machine.

2) I wrote a simple python script that reads the file and line by line
with the use of regular expressions seeks for uncountable nouns, extracts
them into a dictionary and prints them out in the end.
The runtime on my laptop (2GB RAM) was 4mins.

3) All the extracted uncountables (1998) are in the file 'extracted.txt'
For a better layout it is better to open the file with notepad++
or unix terminal.
